# shellcmd
Collection of Terminal commands to be used inside nim. (Unix only for now)

You can see [shellcmd-examples](https://github.com/Alogani/shellcmd-examples) to see some usage

## Under heavy development

For now, each release can have effect on existing code.
This project is not mature enough to be used in production.

Bugs should not break your system ;-) because any bug encoutered will immediatly raise and stop the program. But for critical system, prefer to test your script first inside a virtual machine
